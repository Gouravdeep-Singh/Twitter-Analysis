# Twitter-Analysis
Aim of the project is to access data on twiiter and collect data on certain keywords like bitcoin, crypto currency
then we save the data of each individual keyword into seperate csv files.
Moving on we clean the data which involved stopword removal and visualize the data on hourly and day basis.
Some keywords like GOOG had only 200 tweets so we had to visualize them on hourly basis while keywords like bitcoin had
a thounsand tweet retrieval so they were plotted on daily basis.
